Switch Statements:
1. When is it ideal to use a switch statement?
A: When there are more than two possible paths 

2. Which decision structure is interchangeable with the switch statement?
A: if-else-if

3. Which type of expression does the condition of a switch statement evaluate?
A: Equality

4. Each path of a switch statement is denoted by the word _____
A: Case

5. Which cases of a switch statement are executed?
A: The first one that is true

6. The purpose of the reserved word, break, is to ______
A: End a case block within a switch statement

7. When is the default case within a switch statement executed?
A: When the value being evaluated does not equal any of the case statements

8. What will happen in a case where the break statement is omitted?
A: The next case will also be executed

9. Which decision structure is best for a case where there’s only one conditional path needed?
A: If

10. Which decision structure is best when there’s two conditional paths, where one should be executed if the condition is true and the other if the condition is false?
A: If-Else

11. Which decision structure is used when there are more than two conditional paths and its condition only checks for equality?
A: Switch   

12. Which decision structure can be used when you need to immediately check another condition if the first condition was met?
A: Nested-If
